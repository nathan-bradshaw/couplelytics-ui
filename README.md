# Couplelytics â€” UI (Code Only)

Couplelytics is a personal tool inspired by **singlesatlas.com**, rebuilt from the ground up with modern data and a refined UI. It helps explore and visualize patterns across U.S. cities related to datingâ€‘relevant factors, providing insights through interactive maps and data-driven components. This repository contains the **frontend code**â€”React components, hooks, and shared TypeScript types.

## Overview

- React components and UI logic
- Shared TypeScript types
- Styling and layout with Tailwind CSS

## Exclusions

- Backend/API implementation
- Raw datasets
- Project-level tooling

## Purpose

This separation allows focused sharing of the UI work independently from backend logic and data.

## API & Backend Overview

The backend follows a layered design with clear separation of concerns. Routes handle requests, services handle logic and data access, utilities offer shared functions, and middleware handles crossâ€‘cutting concerns like security and performance.

Responses are pre-shaped server-side to optimize performance. Timing logs track request durations.

### Simplified Request Flow

```
[Client UI]
   â”‚  POST /api/cities
   â–¼
[Routes] â”€â”€â–º [Services] â”€â”€â–º [Data Layer]
   â”‚                        â”‚
   â–¼                        â–¼
[Response] â—„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

## Tech Stack

- React with TypeScript â€” componentâ€‘driven UI with type safety
- Leaflet â€” lightweight and flexible map rendering
- Tailwind CSS â€” rapid iteration and responsive design

## Project Structure

```
apps/ui/
  src/
    components/   # map, drawers, lists, controls
    hooks/        # debounced values, data loading hooks
    utils/        # small helpers
  public/         # static assets (icons, favicon)
shared/types/     # TypeScript interfaces used by the UI
```

## Implementation Notes

All displayed values are computed server-side; the UI is responsible solely for presentation and interaction.
